#Literate Haskell Bird Style
######This .tmLanguage has been made mostly from David's answer on [this question in Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14991061/2046648).     Including a bit of digging about in sublime's folders.

##Installation

1. Download the [`.tmLanguage`](https://bitbucket.org/wrossmck/literate-haskell-bird-style/downloads/Literate%20Haskell%20Bird%20Style.tmLanguage) file.
2. move the `.tmLanguage` file from your Downloads location to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Haskell/` or `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/Haskell/` depending on your version of sublime

Sublime should load it up automatically _(no restart necessary)_, and it will be available as a syntax from the `View->Syntax->Haskell` menu. 

That's it! Happy coding!
